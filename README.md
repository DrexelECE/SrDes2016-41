# Fetch Drone

We're creating a retrieving drone. Tools and inventions generally attempt to make some aspect of our lives easier. Everyone has wished, at least once, that they didn’t have to move to get something. Whether it be your phone, remote control, or a beverage; our project seeks to enable your laziness. We are proposing a design that involves a specialized hook that will be pre-attached to an object we will later want to receive. A customized drone will be designed to pick up this hook, and the item attached to it. The drone will be designed to locate the hook and bring it back to a predefined location.

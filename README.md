# Fetch Drone

This is the Senior Design (Capstone) Project for Drexel ECE Team 41 of 2016.  The team consists of [James Kurtz](/jkrrv), [Corey Schoenfeld](/cscho0415) and [Isabell Welsh](/cymry).  Our advisor is [Dr. John Walsh](http://www.ece.drexel.edu/walsh/web/).  

We're creating a retrieving drone, affectionately referred to as "the drone that brings you beer."  Tools and inventions generally attempt to make some aspect of our lives easier. Everyone has wished, at least once, that they didnâ€™t have to move to get something. Whether it be your phone, remote control, or a beverage; our project seeks to enable your laziness. We are proposing a design that involves a specialized hook that will be pre-attached to an object we will later want to receive. A customized drone will be designed to pick up this hook, and the item attached to it. The drone will be designed to locate the hook and bring it back to a predefined location.

The design involves four major components, assigned to the designated person:

 -  The Drone itself (James)
 -  Flight Control System (James; keeps the thing in the air)
 -  Navigation System (Corey; directs motion)
 -  Hook System (Isabell; includes both hook and claw)
